YGW Eshop Spoofer (Y a Gateway!?)
==================================

### Dependencies

* [ctrcommon](https://github.com/Steveice10/ctrcommon): This one needs to be compiled from source and `make install`.
* **zip**: if you want to get `YgwEshopSpoofer.zip` in the `output` folder, **Optional**. You can get it from GnuWin32 or Msys.

### Compilation
ctrcommon depends on libctru, aemstro, and needs devkitpro to be compiled. To cover that compilation in detail, please check out [this branch](https://github.com/Syphurith/ctrcommon/tree/compilation). I've added some flags for it and it could solve `3ds.h` or `aemstro` issues. Just follow the steps there.
Then back to this repo and simply `make`.
